This is a sandbox for me trying out stuff in the Rust programming language.
The stuff that works and may be used by me in the future will be transferred to the
`perm_util` module.

Tried out the base64 en- and decoding, I'll maybe implement it in another way some time
in the near future, e.g. as a trait implemented on String and str. And when that works
I'll maybe transfer it into the perm_util module.
